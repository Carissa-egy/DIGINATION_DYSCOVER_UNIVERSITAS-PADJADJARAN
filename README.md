# DysCover
DysCover is a mobile application built using Flutter to assist early screening of dyslexia through handwriting analysis and educational resources. It aims to empower parents and educators with AI-powered tools to detect potential dyslexia symptoms and provide helpful learning support.


## 🚀 Features (Current & Planned)

- 📱 Onboarding screens with slider to educate users
- 📤 Upload children's handwriting image
- 📊 Prediction screen with preliminary result (to be connected with model)
- 📰 Educational content: Articles, Journals, News (static for now)
- 🤖 AI Chatbot for parent consultation (in progress)
- 📈 Dashboard to track child’s learning pattern (planned)
- ⭐ Subscription screen (UI planned)
